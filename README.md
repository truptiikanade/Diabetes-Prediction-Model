# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters using the Decision Tree algorithm.

## Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis of diabetes. The model utilizes a dataset of health metrics including glucose levels, BMI, age, etc., to predict the onset of diabetes.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis, handling missing values, feature engineering.
- Model training: Implemented a Decision Tree classifier using Python's scikit-learn library.
- Model evaluation: Achieved 75% accuracy on test data.

## Results
The model's performance was evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The Decision Tree algorithm effectively identified patterns in the dataset and achieved 75% accuracy in predicting diabetes.


## Future Work
- Incorporate more advanced machine learning algorithms for comparison.
- Enhance model performance through feature selection and parameter tuning.
